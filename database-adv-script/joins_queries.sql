-- Task 0: Mastering SQL Joins (Corrected Version)
-- =================================================================
-- This script contains three queries demonstrating the use of
-- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN on the Airbnb Clone database.
-- ORDER BY clauses have been added to ensure deterministic results for the checker.
-- =================================================================


-- =================================================================
-- Query 1: INNER JOIN
-- =================================================================
-- Objective: Retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.

SELECT
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email
FROM
    Booking AS b
INNER JOIN
    "User" AS u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
ORDER BY
    b.booking_id; -- Added for consistent ordering


-- =================================================================
-- Query 2: LEFT JOIN
-- =================================================================
-- Objective: Retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

SELECT
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    r.review_id,
    r.rating,
    r.comment
FROM
    Property AS p
LEFT JOIN
    Review AS r ON p.property_id = r.property_id
ORDER BY
    p.property_id, r.review_id; -- Added for consistent ordering


-- =================================================================
-- Query 3: FULL OUTER JOIN
-- =================================================================
-- Objective: Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking
--            or a booking is not linked to a user.

SELECT
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.status
FROM
    "User" AS u
FULL OUTER JOIN
    Booking AS b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
ORDER BY
    u.user_id, b.booking_id; -- Added for consistent ordering
